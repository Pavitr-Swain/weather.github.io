Hey there! This is a simple weather-themed web app built with plain old HTML & CSS — no frameworks, no JavaScript, just clean and minimal code.

I made this mostly for fun and to play around with basic GitHub Pages deployment.

🔍 What’s Inside?
A neat little weather UI 🌦️

Custom icons for different conditions: rain 🌧️, snow ❄️, mist 🌫️, etc.

Static site — super lightweight and fast

Hosted using GitHub Pages
